# Web Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte

Welcome to the repository for my web development internship at Oasis Infobyte! During my time as an intern, I had the opportunity to work on three exciting projects, each showcasing my skills and creativity in web development.

## Projects:

### 1. Temperature Converter Website
   - Description: This project aimed to create a simple yet functional website for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users can input a value in one unit and instantly see the equivalent values in the other units.
   - Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### 2. Portfolio Website
   - Description: The portfolio website served as to showcase skills, experiences, and projects of a dummy student. It provided an overview of background, education, and achievements, along with a portfolio section highlighting the web development projects.
   - Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### 3. Landing Page
   - Description: The landing page project involved creating an engaging and informative webpage for a fictional product or service. The page aimed to capture visitors' attention, generate interest, and encourage them to take action, such as signing up for a newsletter or exploring more about the product/service.
   - Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## How to Use:
   - Each project has its own directory within this repository. You can navigate to the respective directories to view the source code and files associated with each project.
   - To run the projects locally or deploy them, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the project files in your preferred code editor or web browser.
